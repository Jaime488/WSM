                    but before that, I just wants to say sorry. 
                    This week has been a hell for me lately. 
                    Basta, gi kapoy gyud kaayo ko. 
                    I really just want to feel your love, but I think your actions are just lacking behind.
                    It's enough, but I think it's too slow of a progress compared to our physical intimacy. 
                    Other than that doing just simple things, well for me it is, idk about you, those things,
                      the things that really keeps a relationship going.
                    Like hugs lang bitaw, or maybe a kiss were all initiated by me.
                    Kanang murag ako always bitaw ga first move, you get that? 
                    All I need is just seeing you making the first move of those things.
                    Even rare siya, basta ikaw lang. 
                    I really, really want to feel, or my version of your unconditional love for just once. 
                    It hurts me pouring all of my thoughts in this one message. 
                    I know nga basin ugma ok na ta, balik na ta sa atong usual routine. 
                    But I kinda want you to take note.
